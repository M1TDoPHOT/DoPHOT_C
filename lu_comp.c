/* This module solves linear equations in several variables (Ax = b) using
 * LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row equilibration.  Although
 * slightly more work than Gaussian elimination, it is faster for solving
 * several equations using the same coefficient matrix.  It is
 * particularly useful for matrix inversion, by sequentially solving the
 * equations with the columns of the unit matrix.
 *
 * lu_decompose() decomposes the coefficient matrix into the LU matrix,
 * and lu_solve() solves the series of matrix equations using the
 * previous LU decomposition.
