INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DOPHOT

step 0: CFITSIO

Install the CFITSIO library from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/.  Sorry.  I hate library dependencies too, but I wasn't going to reinvent the wheel on fits io routines.

step 1: Makefile

Look at the Makefile in this directory.  Check the cfitsio path information and make sure it's correct for your machine and cfitsio installation.  As packaged it's correct for a mac.

step 2: Check your files

A complete dophot set should include:
     (1) a bunch of .c files
     (2) a directory named headers/ with a bunch of .h files
     (3) a directory named structs/ with a bunch of .h files
     (4) a directory named verif_data/ which contains
          an image: J0159.8.chip_01.fits
          an input object list: obj_in_J0159.8
          a default parameter file: param_default_c
          a modified parameter file: pm
          two subdirectories: (models (ignore for now) 
                                 and compare_out)
               compare_out contains the output files from the 
               fits that you will compare with your own test run

step 3: Make

Type in "make test" at the top directory.  This should take a minute and populate your source directory with .o files for each of the .c files.  If your CFITSIO library wasn't installed properly or isn't properly declared in your Makefile, now's when you'll hear about it.  If any other errors or warnings pop-up, address them for your machine and/or contact rsobel@mit.edu.

In absence of warnings, 'make test' will have created an executable in verif_data called dophot. 

step 4: Test

Open the verif_data directory and type './dophot' at the command line.  You should be prompted for a parameter modification file.  Type in 'pm' and hit return.  Dophot should execute in a number of seconds and report 6 output files matching the ones in the compare_out subdirectory. Feel free to examine all of them, but in particular diff 
     obj_out_J0159.8.chip_01
     shad_out_J0159.8.chip_01
     image_out_J0159.8.chip_01.fits
     psf_out_J0159.8.chip_01.fit
with the compare_out files.  If there are any discrepancies, in obj_out_, something has gone wrong and you are not working with a pristine copy of dophot.  If there are any discrepancies wit the latter three files, please notify rsobel@mit.edu.  There may be nothing wrong, but I would like to know.

step 5: Go

Make a directory for your data named working_data, copy the executable (dophot), param_default_c, and parameter modification (pm) files there and start altering the pm file according to the manual instructions until you get photometry you are happy with.  Typing `make dophot' at the command line will populate 'working_data' with a copy of the dophot executable as well.  Dophot's working, it's on you.
